# Technical Specification and Tech Stack

# General rules
- Before running any series of command, refresh your memory on the current folder by running `pwd`.
- Always ask if the tool is not explicitly listed here. Never assume it's ok to use a library or technology

# Technologies
- No emojis EVER. You will use Lucide React for icons instead.
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript
  - SSR for good SEO especially on the landing page and event pages
- React form hook for anything forms
- Always use PNPM/PNPX. NEVER use yarnx, yarn, npm or npx.
- UI must use ShadCN. NEVER assume that a component is installed. Instead, scan @components/ui and check. If it's not installed, then you can install it.
- Framer motion for animation. Do not over use, but do use to create a more SLEEK experience.
